Hello! my name is Kei for short. <br>

I sit on Pony Town almost daily! Usually semi afk  <br>
I am mostly a dry texter <br>
(, yet I tend to get real hyper once I am comfortable with you) <br>
Autistic, sometimes I need tonetags when we are joking around <br>
I use most emoticons unironically <br>

Please note I am not an native english speaker, nor I can express my self very well  <br>
I enjoy a lot of media, such as Stardew Valley, Deltarune, Arcane, Splatoon, Friday Night Funkin  <br>
(other NG media too), Ultrakill, and lots of, lots of more <br>
You can sit with me anytime I am alone! no need to ask :] <br>
